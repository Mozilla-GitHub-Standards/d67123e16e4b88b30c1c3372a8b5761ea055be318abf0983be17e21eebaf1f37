It means instead enabling others to share and build upon the work you want the Net to love. Practice the freedom you expect from others, by licensing your work as freely as you can."{% endblocktrans %}</blockquote>

		<p>{% blocktrans %}The Web is an integral part of modern life.<br />
		It is an educator, a communicator, an entertainer, an inspirer, a collaboration of all our creative efforts.<br />
		It sparks movements and enables us to share our ideas, our thoughts, our dreams.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
		<p>{% blocktrans %}The Web is our creation.<br />
		We are all contributors, the ones who use the Web every day.<br />
		And all the comments and uploads we make add up to something bigger.<br />
		This is why we believe that the Web must remain open and accessible to all.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
		<p>{% blocktrans %}Mark Up is a celebration of that freedom.<br />
		Each personâ€™s mark is an individual expression on a continuous line symbolizing solidarity.<br />
		It is a declaration and a chance to show your support for a people's Web.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
